With the help of these technologies, many applications can be installed outside the virtual machine, but also can provide services for the virtual machine, such as security monitoring software, virus detection software. But the technology must overcome a problem, the semantic gap: the management program can see the city state and their virtual machine within the expression of the semantic separation. This article focuses on the use of introspection technology to monitor the kernel process and the days of stepping on the various pit.
